# right-to-be-forgotten

“Right to be Forgotten” is a right to have private information removed from the internet search engine, database, websites or other public platforms.

## Ideas

1. Standardizing the url for delete account section across all websites using a **Well-Known URI** like [/delete-account][deleteacc] for easy access. It can then be used by various tools like password managers to programatically open `delete account` page.

[deleteacc]: ./delete-account.md
